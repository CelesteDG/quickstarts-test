# Call the Microsoft Graph API from a Windows Desktop app

This quickstart contains a code sample that demonstrates how a Windows Desktop .NET (WPF) can sign in personal, work and school accounts, get an access token, and call the Microsoft Graph API.

![How the sample app generated by this guide works](media/active-directory-windesktop/windesktophowitworks.png)

## Step 1: Download your web server or project

- [Download the Visual Studio 2017 project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2/archive/master.zip)

> [!div renderon="docs"]
> ## Step 2: Register your application
> 
> 1. To register an application, go to the [Azure AD - Application Registration](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/portal/register-app)
> 1. Enter a name for your application and click **Create**
> 1. Click *Save*

## Step 3: Configure your Visual Studio project

1. Copy the value for **Application ID** to the clipboard
1. Open the project in Visual Studio
1. Edit **App.Xaml.cs** and replace <code>Enter_the_Application_Id_here</code> with the Application ID from the application you just registered:

    ```csharp
    private static string ClientId = "Enter_the_Application_Id_here";
    ```

## More Information

Below an overview of this Quickstart:

### MSAL.NET

MSAL ([Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client)) is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by Microsoft Azure Active Directory. You can install it by running the following command in Visual Studio's *Package Manager Console*:

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Identity.Client -Pre
```

### MSAL Initialization

You can add the reference for MSAL by adding the line below:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
```

Then initialize MSAL using the line below:

```csharp
public static PublicClientApplication PublicClientApp = new PublicClientApplication(ClientId);
```

> |Where: ||
> |---------|---------|
> |ClientId | The Application Id from the application registered in *portal.microsoft.com* |

### Requesting tokens

Msal has two methods used acquire tokens - `AcquireTokenAsync` and `AcquireTokenSilentAsync`:

#### Getting a user token interactively

 Some situations require forcing users interact with Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint via an popup window to either validate their credentials or five consent â€“ some examples include:

- The first time users signs-in to the application
- Users may need to reenter their credentials because the password has expired
- Your application is requesting access to a resource that the user needs to consent to
- Two factor authentication is required

```csharp
authResult = await App.PublicClientApp.AcquireTokenAsync(_scopes);
```

> |Where:||
> |---------|---------|
> |_scopes | Contains the scopes being requested (i.e. `{ "user.read" }` for Microsoft Graph or `{ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" }` for custom Web APIs) |

#### Getting a user token silently

You don't want to require user to validate their credentials every time they need to access a resource - most of the time you want token acquisitions and renewal without any user interaction - `AcquireTokenSilentAsync` is the method commonly used to obtain tokens used to access protected resources after the initial `AcquireTokenAsync`:

```csharp
authResult = await App.PublicClientApp.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(_scopes, App.PublicClientApp.Users.FirstOrDefault());
```

> |Where: ||
> |---------|---------|
> |_scopes | Contains the scopes being requested (i.e. `{ "user.read" }` for Microsoft Graph or `{ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" }` for custom Web APIs) |
 |App.PublicClientApp.Users.FirstOrDefault() | The first user in the cache (MSAL support multiple users in a single app) |
