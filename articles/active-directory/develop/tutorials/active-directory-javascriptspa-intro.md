# JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) tutorial - Introduction & Setup

This tutorial demonstrates how a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) can sign in personal, work and school accounts, get an access token, and call the Microsoft Graph API or other APIs that require access tokens from the Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint.

### Libraries

This guide uses the following library:

|Library|Description|
|---|---|
|[msal.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)|Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript Preview|

> [!NOTE]
> *msal.js* targets the *Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint* - which enables personal, school and work accounts to sign in and acquire tokens. The *Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint* has [some limitations](..\active-directory-v2-limitations.md). If you are interested only in school and work accounts, use *adal.js* and the *V1 endpoint*. 
> To understand differences between the v1 and v2 endpoints read the [v1-v2 comparison](..\active-directory-v2-compare.md).
