# Sign-in users and acquire an access token from a JavaScript application

This quickstart contains a code sample that demonstrates how a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) can sign in personal, work and school accounts, get an access token, and call the Microsoft Graph API.

![How the sample app generated by this guide works](media/active-directory-javascriptspa/javascriptspa-intro.png)

> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal"]
> ## Step 1: Configure your application in Azure Portal
> For the code sample for this quickstart to work, you need to add a reply URL as *http<span/>://localhost:30662/*.
> > [!div renderon="portal" id="makechanges" class="nextstepaction"]
> > [Make these changes for me]()

> [!div renderon="docs"]
> ## Step 1: Register your application
> 
> 1. To register an application, go to the [Azure AD - Application Registration](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/portal/register-app)
> 2. Enter a name for your application and click **Create**
> 3. Follow the instructions to add a reply URL to your app and configure your code sample

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Visual Studio, the Redirect URL will be set to to *http:<span/>//localhost:30662/* as it is configured in the code sample's project. If you use Python or any other web server, set redirect URL to *http://<span/>localhost:30662/*, run the following command line:
>> ```bash
>> python -m http.server 30662
>> ```

## Step 2: Download your web server or project

- [Download the Visual Studio project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/VisualStudio.zip)
- [Download the core project files - for a local web server, such as Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/core.zip)

### Libraries

This guide uses the following library:

|Library|Description|
|---|---|
|[msal.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)|Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript Preview|

> [!NOTE]
> *msal.js* targets the *Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint* - which enables personal, school and work accounts to sign in and acquire tokens. The *Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint* has [some limitations](..\active-directory-v2-limitations.md). If you are interested only in school and work accounts, use *adal.js* and the *V1 endpoint*. 
> To understand differences between the v1 and v2 endpoints read the [v1-v2 comparison](..\active-directory-v2-compare.md).

## Setting up your web server or project

## Prerequisites
A local web server such as [Python http.server](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server/), [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core), or IIS Express integration with [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) is required to run this guided setup. 

Instructions in this guide are based on both Python and Visual Studio 2017, but feel free to use any other development environment or Web Server.

## Create your project

> ### Option 1: Visual Studio 
> If you are using Visual Studio and are creating a new project, follow the steps below to create a new Visual Studio solution:
> 1. In Visual Studio:  `File` > `New` > `Project`
> 1. Under `Visual C#\Web`, select `ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)`
> 1. Name your application and click *OK*
> 1. Under `New ASP.NET Web Application`, select `Empty`

<p/><!-- -->

> ### Option 2: Python/ other web servers
> Make sure you have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then follow the step below:
> -	Create a folder to host your application.
